✅ Increment 1: Single Partition Backfill
✅ Increment 2: Partition Range Backfill
⏳ Increment 3: Backfill Execution (wires jobs to actually run)
⏳ Increment 4: Progress Tracking & Resumption
⏳ Increment 5: Upstream Propagation
⏳ Increment 6: Observability

⚠️ Outstanding items to reach full plan parity:
Backfill upstream propagation (run upstream partitions first) and final observability polish.
Partition runtime support (execute partition-aware scheduling/mappings beyond SDK metadata).
Optional: refactor backfill progress API to drop clippy warnings; manage metric cardinality for per-job gauges if needed.
