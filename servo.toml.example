# Servo CLI Configuration Example
#
# Copy this file to one of these locations:
#   - ./servo.toml (current directory - highest priority)
#   - ~/.config/servo/config.toml (user config)
#
# Or set SERVO_CONFIG environment variable to an explicit path.
#
# SECURITY NOTE: This file may contain sensitive values (e.g., database_url
# with credentials). Ensure it is:
#   - NOT committed to version control (add to .gitignore)
#   - Protected with appropriate file permissions (chmod 600)
#   - For production, prefer environment variables or secret managers
#
# Configuration precedence (highest to lowest):
#   1. CLI arguments (--database-url)
#   2. Environment variables (DATABASE_URL, etc.)
#   3. Config file
#   4. Defaults

# Database connection URL
# Can also be set via DATABASE_URL environment variable
database_url = "postgresql://servo:servo@localhost:5432/servo"

# Cloud provider: "gcp", "aws", or "local"
# Can also be set via CLOUD_PROVIDER environment variable
# cloud_provider = "gcp"

# GCP project ID (required when cloud_provider = "gcp")
# Can also be set via PROJECT_ID environment variable
# project_id = "my-gcp-project"
